<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Eduardo Bandol jr. I am currently in a semicon industry and planning to shift work to a programmer </p>

<p>It's really hard to shift from one job to another with different a nature of work. I've been in the manufacturing industry for a couple of years, and it's so-so. 
  Sometimes it's good, and there are challenging times.
</p>

<p>What really convinced me to shift to a programmer is because of a better compensation which will help my family especially my three little kids with
  their basic needs like foods and education etc. I know it's a big step for me but I'm focus and determine to overcome challenges that I will face with 
  this new journey
